 # TRELLO PROYECT

 this is a proyect using `HTML`, `SASS` and `JavaScript` to create a simple to-do list app.
 We're looking to create a layout and give functionality to a task application, focused on advanced `CSS` with animations, and modularized with the `SASS` preprocessor, and advanced programming logic with ES modules, and OOP.
 

 ## Technologies used

 - `HTML5` for structure and content.
 - `SASS` for styling and layout.
 - `JavaScript` for functionality and logic.
 - `ES Modules` for the modularization of the app
 - `POO` for object-oriented programming 

 ## Links to resources
 
 Some images and resources were taken from:

 - [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
 - [Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/archivo:trello-logo-bkue.svg)
 - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass)

## commands used for SASS

To modularize the CSS, we used the SASS preprocessor, and the following commands were run in the terminal:

1. Download [`node`](https://node.js.org/es) to download packages as `SASS.`
2. Verify that Node and npm were installed correctly:
```
node -v
npm -v

```
3. Install the `SASS` package in the proyect:

```
npm install sass --save-dev

```

4. create the file `.SCSS` with which we'll work for:

```
touch styles.scss

```

5. we run `SASS` to convert our `scss` into regular `css`:

```

npx sass styles.scss style.css

```

6. If we want to always update the `css`, when we make any changes, we add the `--watch` flag:

```

npx sass --watch styles.scss style.css

```
